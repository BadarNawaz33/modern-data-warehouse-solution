# 🌟 Modern Data Warehouse Solution

👋 **Hi there, Data Enthusiasts!**

I'm **Badar Nawaz**, a passionate Data Analyst and Engineer.  
Welcome to the **Modern Data Warehouse Solution** — an end-to-end project focused on scalable, efficient, and analytics-ready data warehousing using **PostgreSQL**! 🚀

---

## 🪄 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to building a **modern data warehouse**, focusing on clean data flows, strong architecture, and deep analytical insights.

🔹 **Key Areas**:
- ETL Pipeline Development (Extract → Transform → Load)
- Star Schema Data Modeling
- Advanced SQL Analytics & Reporting
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

---

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The solution follows a **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

- **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion from ERP/CRM systems (CSV format)
- **Silver Layer**: Cleaned, structured, and integrated datasets
- **Gold Layer**: Business-ready data using a star schema for advanced analytics

🛠 **Architecture Overview**:

## 🌐 Data Flow

A simplified view of the data movement across layers:

```
ERP/CRM Data (CSV) → Bronze Layer (Raw Storage)
→ Silver Layer (Cleaned & Integrated)
→ Gold Layer (Star Schema Model)
→ Reporting & Business Insights
```
